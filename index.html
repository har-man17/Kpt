                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>ISKCON, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, is a global spiritual movement rooted in the teachings of the ancient Vedic texts, particularly the Bhagavad-gita and
                    Srimad Bhagavatam. At the heart of ISKCON's mission is the promotion of bhakti-yoga, or the yoga of devotion, with a central focus on loving service to Lord Krishna, whom devotees regard as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. ISKCON
                    temples, often built in traditional Indian architectural styles, serve as sacred spaces where the divine presence of Krishna is enshrined. These temples typically feature intricate altars adorned with beautifully dressed deities of
                    Radha and Krishna, where daily rituals and ceremonies, such as arati (offering of lights) and kirtan (devotional singing), are conducted with deep reverence and joy. The temple environment is one of spiritual vibrancy, where the chanting
                    of the Hare Krishna mantra resonates through the prayer halls, creating an atmosphere of peace and devotion.</p>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Daily Meditations</h3>
                    <p>ISKCON temples offer a range of services designed to nurture the spiritual growth and well-being of devotees and visitors alike. Daily meditation is a cornerstone of the temple's spiritual practice, where individuals are encouraged
                        to engage in japa (chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra on beads) and participate in guided meditation sessions. These practices help cultivate inner peace, focus, and a deeper connection with the divine, allowing participants to
                        experience the transformative power of Krishna consciousness in their daily lives.</p>

                    <h3>Spiritual Counseling</h3>
                    <p>Spiritual counseling is another vital service provided by ISKCON temples, where experienced devotees and spiritual mentors offer guidance and support on personal and spiritual matters. These counseling sessions are rooted in the teachings
                        of the Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic scriptures, providing individuals with practical advice and insights on how to navigate life's challenges while staying true to the principles of bhakti-yoga. Whether one is dealing with personal
                        struggles, relationship issues, or seeking clarity on their spiritual path, ISKCON's spiritual counselors offer compassionate and wise counsel to help individuals find peace and purpose.</p>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Retreats</h3>
                    <p>For those seeking a deeper immersion in spiritual life, ISKCON temples often host retreats that provide an opportunity for extended periods of reflection, study, and practice. These retreats are held in serene environments, often in
                        the temple's ashram or a nearby spiritual center, and include activities such as scriptural study, kirtan, meditation, and service. Participants are encouraged to disconnect from the distractions of daily life and immerse themselves
                        in the sacred atmosphere, allowing for profound spiritual experiences and personal growth. These retreats are designed to rejuvenate the mind, body, and soul, offering a chance to deepen one's understanding of Krishna consciousness
                        and build lasting spiritual connections with fellow practitioners.</p>
